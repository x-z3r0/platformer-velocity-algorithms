## Platformer Velocity Algorithms
This project is a brief example of how to achieve smooth movement in platformers by solving the following problems:
- Getting the acceleration and friction for a specified max speed and time.

- [Kinetic equations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equations_of_motion) to calculate the initial velocity and gravity required to reach a specified jump height and jump time.
