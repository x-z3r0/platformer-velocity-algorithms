## Platformer Velocity Algorithms
This project is a brief example of how to achieve smooth movement in platformers using the following algorithms:
- Getting the acceleration and friction for a specified max speed and time.

- Kinetic equations to calculate the initial velocity and gravity required to reach a specified jump height and jump time.

### Installation
